# landing-page
This is another assignment from The Odin Project that builds on the foundations of HTML and CSS.

The project consists of developing a landing page based on a design provided by the course. The assignment requires the use of flexbox to build the web page.

I decided to personalize the content of the project and made it into a landing page for a website that recommends restaurants to the user.

From this project, I learned:

* How to use the box model to resize the elements of a page
* How to use flexbox to move the elements in a page
